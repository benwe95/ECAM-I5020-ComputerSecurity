# Coding 3: Input validation

## Instructions

For this assessment, you have to write a small command line application that asks the user for some
(structured) inputs (2â€“3) and check them thoroughly with several check levels (syntax with regular
expression, correct type, domain for accepted values, presence in a database of valid values, etc.)
Pay attention to the following elements:
* The design and content of the application is not important.
* Send good and relevant messages to the user to help him/her understand what was wrong with
his/her inputs.

Prepare yourself for the following manipulations/questions:
* Show several usage scenarios (correct and wrong) of your application
* How can you be sure that you covered all the cases?
* What should be checked when dealing with user inputs?
* What is the drawback of writing more robust code regarding input validation?
