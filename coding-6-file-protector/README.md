# Coding 6: file protector

## Instructions
For this assessment, you have to write a small command line program that can encrypt or decrypt
a file. The first parameter of your program should be either -E to encrypt or -D to decrypt and the
second parameter is the path to the file to encrypt or decrypt. When the program is launched, it has
to prompt the user for the encryption/decryption key.

Pay attention to the following elements:
* Check carefully all the inputs of your program.
* You can choose how you handle the location of the encrypted/decrypted file.

Prepare yourself for the following manipulations/questions:
* Encrypt and decrypt a given file.
* How are the bad parameters handled (wrong format, wrong number of parameters, etc.) and
how a bad key is handled?
* Why encrypting files may help to protect a system against malware?
